            About:
        </h1>
        <p>Researching a topic, we found a number of real-world problems that affect us in our daily lives and can lead to many health issues. We found that people who watch a lot of television tend to get glasses as a result. It was our main goal to find out the worst case scenario so we can avoid it and use electronics in a safe manner. Blue light is causing a lot of people to get glasses. Seventy-five percent wear contact lenses or eyeglasses. Staying on a screen too long can give you backaches and a bad mood. Lastly, you want to put it into a habit to limit your screen time daily, you may gain weight and have sleeping issues. The way we did it was by making a Google form and having various people fill it out, then we analyzed all our data and put it into a graph.
